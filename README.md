## Class Setup

## About this project
An implementation of selection sort / insertion sort of a linked list with each node holding a key-value pair.  The project also uses these functions:
- add
- remove
- find
- range find
- keys (returns all keys by reference)
- sort (ascending order)
- size

Selection sort and insertion sort are not the most efficient sorting algorithms for randomly generated key value pairs.




Note: Need to have Cmake installed
